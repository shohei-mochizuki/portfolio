        <h1 class="text-dark">About Me</h1>
        <div class="mt-5 mx-5 p-5 bg-light rounded-5">
          <p>I love making a plan, solving problems/issues and creating something meaningful. This is why I started my career as a civil engineer, which gave me a lot of opportunities to conduct academic researches and to participate in construction projects for a better future. These projects usually took from a year to several years and threw me a lot of tough problems but solving them by working with other team members using engineering and project management skills was a thrilling challenge for me and I had great experience with them. It also gave me a chance to work in an international environment and this is when I realized that working in a diverse environment was what I would like for the rest of my career and it encouraged me to move to Canada.<br><br>

          The last five years, I worked for or at Twitter to keep the online platform safe for everyone. My main focus was on analyzing safety and misinformation related data and managing programs and projects. As a large international tech company, Twitter had many on-going programs and projects at the same time and working in such a fast pace was not easy. However, this gave me a chance to develop my project management skills and learn how to solve issues by working with different departments. During my career with Twitter, I also developed my data analytic skills by taking a Python Data Science bootcamp course and by using SQL and Google App Script in the daily works.<br><br> 
            
          Currently I'm taking a full stack developer bootcamp so that I can improve my coding skills on HTML, CSS, JavaScript and its APIs and libraries such as Node.js, and Express.js. I am glad to find that my passion on planning, solving issues and creating something meaningful helps me a lot in this field. I am also very willing to learn new libraries and languages so that I will be able to create something which I can't do so with my current skills.<br><br>
          
          I am looking forward to working with people from different backgrounds, solving problems/issues together and creating something meaningful for a better future!</p>
